To compile the demos do the following:

   use "init.pkg";
   use "<program name>";

 
The first set of programs are translated from the Gtk tutorial. 
   NAME             STATUS

   arrows.pkg       working 
   calendar.pkg     working          (some slight problem with
                                      gtk_widget_destroyed())

   entry.pkg        working
   hello.pkg        working
   menu.pkg         working
   notebook.pkg     working
   paned.pkg        working  
   pop-ups.pkg      working
   rangewidgets.pkg working
   scrolledwin.pkg  working
   spinbutton.pkg   working
   statusbar.pkg    working
   text.pkg         working
   drawing.pkg      broken??           

The rest are to demonstrate the gadgets programming extensions:
   NAME             STATUS

   gadgets.pkg      working   
   help-menu.pkg    working
   help-menu2.pkg   working
   calc.pkg         working
