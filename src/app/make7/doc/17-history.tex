\section{Some history}

Although its programming model is more general, make7's implementation is
closely tied to the Standard ML programming language~\cite{milner97}
and its SML/NJ implementation~\cite{appel91:sml}.

The current version is preceded by several other compilation managers.
Of those, the most recent went by the same name
``make7''~\cite{blume95:cm}, while earlier ones were known as IRM ({\it
Incremental Recompilation Manager})~\cite{harper94:irm} and SC (for
{\it Separate Compilation})~\cite{harper-lee-pfenning-rollins-CM}.  make7
owes many ideas to SC and IRM.

Separate compilation heavily relies on mechanisms
for converting static environments (i.e., the compiler's symbol
tables) into linear byte stream suitable for storage on
disks~\cite{appel94:sepcomp}.  However, unlike all its predecessors,
the current implementation of make7 is integrated into the main compiler
and no longer relies on the {\em Visible Compiler} interface.
