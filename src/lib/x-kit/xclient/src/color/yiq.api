# "YIQ is the color space used by the NTSC color TV system"

#
# Above article notes that it can also be useful in image
# processing -- histogram equalization in RGB sucks, but
# doing it on the Y (brightness) component in YIQ format
# works well to equalize brightness.  (Presumably HSV or
# such would work as well?)
