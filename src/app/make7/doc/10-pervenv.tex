\section{The pervasive environment}

The {\em pervasive environment} can be thought of as a compilation
unit that all compilation units implicitly depend upon.  The pervasive
enviroment exports all non-modular namings (types, values, infix
operators, overloaded symbols) that are mandated by the specification
for the Standard ML Basis Library~\cite{reppy99:basis}.  (All other
namings of the Basis Library are exported by {\tt \$/stdlib.make6} which is
a genuine make7 library.)

The pervasive environment is the only place where make7 conveys
non-modular namings from one compilation unit to another, and its
definition is fixed.
