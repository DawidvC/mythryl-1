# Compiled by:

# This could notionally expand into a complete
# 'map' function for raw syntax;  for now, it
# implements just what is needed for implicit
# thunk parameters.



###             "Paul Erdos has a theory that
###              God has a book containing
###              all the theorems of mathematics
###              with their absolutely most beautiful proofs,
###              and when he wants to express
###              particular appreciation of a proof
###              he exclaims, ``This is from the book!''"
