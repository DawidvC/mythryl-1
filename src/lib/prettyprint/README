This is a library for pretty printing.  It provides a much richer
pretty printing model than the Oppen-style pretty printer provided
by the compiler.

Its implementation is based on one by Pierre Weis (Copyright INRIA 1996),
which was written in CAML: See
    

This implementation differs in a number of ways from the CAML version:

  1) This pretty printer does not support tabulation boxes yet.

  2) This pretty-printer is genericized over abstract output
     devices and input tokens.

  3) This pretty-printer supports styled text.

  4) This pretty-printer supports both absolute and relative indentation
     modes (the former is necessary for block-structured language
     indentation).

  5) This pretty-printer supports both imperative pretty-printer streams
     and declarative pretty-printing layouts, which can be intermixed.

The main apis and implementation can be found in the src directory.
The devices directory has some sample output devices (including one for
generating layouts in HTML).  Someday, the examples directory will have
some example pretty-printers; for now, you can look in the tests directory.
