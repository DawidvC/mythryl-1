Installation instructions for Mythryl-Yacc
------------------------------------------

Mythryl-Yacc will normally be automatically
installed as part of the system
by the installer.

To install by hand (e.g., if you make
your own modifications), run the

    ./build

script in this directory and then move
the file

    src/app/mythryl-yacc.$ARCHITECTURE-$OS

to the heap-file directory.

Running ./build requires a properly
functioning installation.
If you make modifications to lexer or
parser, be sure to also have properly
functioning instances of mythryl-lex and
mythryl-yacc installed before you run
./build.
