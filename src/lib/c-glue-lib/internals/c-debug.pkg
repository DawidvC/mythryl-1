package c_debug: (weak) Ckit_Debug {		# Ckit_Debug	is from   src/lib/c-glue-lib/c-debug.api

    #  First of all, we look mostly like package c... 
    #
    include c;

    #  ... but then, we also check for NULL pointers... 
    #
    exception NULL_POINTER;

    #  ... which means that we have to re-implement some things: 
    #
    package ptr {
	include ptr;
	my deref' =   fn p =  if (is_null' p ) raise exception NULL_POINTER; else deref' p; fi;
	my deref  =   fn p =  if (is_null  p ) raise exception NULL_POINTER; else deref  p; fi;
    };
};
