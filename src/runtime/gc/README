This directory contains the garbage collector and a library for
reading and writing heap images.

The two basic operations are importing/exporting an entire heap
image, and blasting in/out an ML data package.  In both cases,
references to addresses outside the heap must be marked on output
and patched on input.

NB:
The way things are done now, the registration of runtime system addresses
is always done.  For stand-alone systems, this shouldn't be necessary.
We might be able to avoid this by using function pointers to the CGlobals
functions, which get set to the right functions in the heap-io library.
Thus, if the heap-io stuff isn't included, then the CGlobals stuff won't
be linked either.
