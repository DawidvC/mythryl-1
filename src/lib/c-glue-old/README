Notes on the rudimentary C interface rooted at this directory.

This file provides installation instructions and details on adding
Mythryl-callable C functions to the runtime system using the  C 
interface.  With this interface one can call C functions that are 
passed (and return) integers, floats, doubles, arrays, structs and unions,
and functions.  C functions may also return arbitrary C pointers to Mythryl7 which 
the Mythryl7 program may supply as arguments to C functions at later times.

The 'smlnj-c.ps' file in the './doc' directory describes the 
design, implementation, and operation of the C interface.  It contains
examples of calling C functions from Mythryl7.

1 Installation
--------------

The interface consists of two parts: a C part in the runtime and
a Mythryl7 part that must be explicitly loaded (into a program running with 
the C-interface runtime).  The C part is already contained in the
C runtime, but must be explicitly configured.

1.1 Building the C-interface runtime
------------------------------------

The runtime system contains the C interface in the 
'src/runtime/c-libs/lib7-ccalls' directory.  You must explicitly 
build a runtime that supports this interface as follows:
If the file 'runtime/o/mk.<arch>-<os>-ccalls' does not
exist, create one by:

	(0) cloning 'mk.<arch>-<os>' as 'mk.<arch>-<os>-ccalls'
	(1) adding -DC_CALLS to the makefile's DEF variable
	(2) making sure the makefile defines XCLIBS as:
		XCLIBS = ../c-libs/lib7-ccalls/liblib7-ccalls.a
	(3) making sure XCLIBS is passed to 'make' for the 'all:' 
	    target as:
		XCLIBS="$(XCLIBS)"

A sample makefile (mk.mipseb-irix5-c-calls) is attached to this file.

Build a C-interface runtime by issuing the command
	make -f mk.<arch>-<os>-ccalls
in the 'runtime/o' directory.  Move the resulting 'runtime7.<arch>-<os>'
file to 'bin/runtime7'.

The second part of the Mythryl7-C interface is a library of Mythryl7 code that 
declares data types for constructing data that can be passed to C functions.  
This part also provides the facilities for registering the C functions that 
Mythryl7 can call.  This part of the interface must be loaded into the Mythryl7 system
before C functions can be registered and then called.


1.2 Installing the Mythryl7 Interface Library
----------------------------------------

The Mythryl7 interface library resides in this directory.

The important files are:

   c-calls.api
   c-calls.pkg
   cc-info.<compiler>.pkg

The 'c-calls' files are the interface.  The interface is a generic
(ccalls) parameterized by info about the underlying C compiler (via
the 'cc-info.<compiler>.pkg' files).  

cc-info files are Mythryl7 packages that supply the C interface
(ccalls generic) with information about the C compiler.

The shell script gen-cc-info can be used to automatically generate
a cc-info.<compiler>.pkg for given compiler.  Usage: 
	 gen-cc-info cc-to-use name-for-package >outfile
 i.e.: % gen-cc-info gcc gcc_info_x86_linux >cc-info.x86-linux.pkg

(make sure you're running on the named platform when you give the
gen-cc-info command!).

Alternately, cc-info files can be made manually.  See, for example,
cc-info.defaults.pkg (should be good for most 32-bit platforms) 
or cc-info.mipseb-irix5.pkg

The 'Makefile.make6' file allows the Mythryl7 make facility make7 to
build the interface.  At a mythryl7-cm prompt, do a 'make7.make()'.

Alternately, the file 'load.pkg' shows how to put it all together.  
"Using" it at the top level creates an instance on an interface 
(and utility functions used by that interface).


2 Usage
-------

2.1 Adding C Functions
----------------------

Installation of the runtime as described above links in the C functions 
in 'src/runtime/c-libs/c-calls/cutil.c'.  The C functions defined 
in 'cutil.c' are bound to names that Mythryl7 programs can find through 
the file 'cutil-cfuns.c'.  Each function imported to Mythryl7 from 
'cutil.c' has a line such as:

	C_CALLS_CFUNC("ptos",	ptos,	char *,	(void *))

in 'cutil-cfuns.h'.  This line registers the C function 'ptos'
with name 'ptos', return type 'int', and arg type(s) 'char *'
with the Mythryl7 runtime.  A C_CALLS_CFUNC line must exist for every 
user C function callable from Mythryl7.  

The file 'cutil-cfuns.h' must be included by the file 'cfun-list.h'.
When adding a set of related functions, it is useful to place their
C_CALLS_FUNC entries in a '*-cfuns.h' file and to then include this
file from 'cfun-list.h'.  For example, to add a new file 'f.c' of C 
functions, create a file 'f-cfuns.h' with C_CALLS_CFUNC definitions for 
all functions exported by 'f.c'.  Add a '#include "f-cfuns.h"' to 
'cfun-list.h'.  Edit 'makefile' to build 'f.o', i.e. add 'f.o' to the 
makefile's C_CALLS_OBJS variable and add a rule for 'f.o' 
(see, for example, the rule for 'cutil.o').


2.2 Linking in C libraries
--------------------------

Adding a C function may require linking against some C library
not currently linked against by the Mythryl7 runtime.  These libraries
can be linked against as follows.

Edit 'src/runtime/o/mk.<arch>-<os>-calls' and alter the LD_LIBS variable
to include the desired libraries.  For example, 

	LD_LIBS =	-lX11 -lm -lmalloc

links in the malloc, math and X11 libs.


2.3 Calling C Functions from Mythryl7
-------------------------------

Refer to the paper 'smlnj-c.ps' for instructions on registering and 
calling C functions that have been added to the runtime system.

The file 'cutil.pkg' in this directory provides a few examples.
