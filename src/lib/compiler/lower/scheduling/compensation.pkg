###                "For myself, I can only say that I am astonished
###                 and somewhat terrified at the results of this
###                 evening's experiments. Astonished at the wonderful
###                 power you have developed, and terrified at the
###                 thought that so much hideous and bad music may
###                 be put on record forever."

###                    -- Sir Arthur Sullivan, message to Edison, 1888
