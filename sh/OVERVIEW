This directory contains various files used during
installation.  It may be deleted after installation
is complete, if desired.

Most are scripts which are directly executed.

_*: The files whose names start with an underline are
    script templates containing @SHELL@ type variables
    which need to be replaced by values appropriate to
    the system on which installation is being done.
    The variable-substituted versions of these scripts
    wind up in ../bin.

overview.*:
    These files get copied into directories created by
    the install scripts, always under the name OVERVIEW.
