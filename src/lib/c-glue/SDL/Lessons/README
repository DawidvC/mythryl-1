WHAT'S IN HERE
--------------

These SML demos are translated from C by me (Allen Leung). 
The original appears in the OpenGL tutorial at:

http://www.libsdl.org/opengl/intro.html
and

http://nehe.gamedev.net/opengl.asp

You should visit these pages to see the detailed explanation.

INSTALLATION
------------
These programs require both SDL and OpenGL to work.  
This means you have to install both SDL and OpenGL before 
compiling the programs in this directory.

Tutorials 6 onward, which involve textual mapping, require data 
files from the original tutorials.  You can get it from the page:

   http://www.libsdl.org/opengl/intro.html

Or via this link directly (assuming the version hasn't been updated):
   http://www.libsdl.org/opengl/OpenGL-intro-1.1.1.tar.gz

Untar the bundle in this directory and you're ready to go.

To compile them, do 

  CM.make "lessons.cm";

Run them executing the main program (on the commandline or 
SMLofNJ.spawn_to_disk them into standalone programs).  The ESC key will exit
these demos.
