# Strings with fast inequality operations.  This should probably be replaced
# with "names, " but there are problems with creating names that are statically
# initialized in threadkit.  Once there is a "threadkit shell, " we can replace this by
# the THREADKIT_Name package.




###             "To get the right word in the right place is a rare achievement.
###              To condense the diffused light of a page of thought into
###              the luminous flash of a single sentence, is worthy to rank
###              as a prize composition just by itself... Anybody can have ideas --
###              the difficulty is to express them without squandering a quire of paper
###              on an idea that ought to be reduced to one glittering paragraph."
