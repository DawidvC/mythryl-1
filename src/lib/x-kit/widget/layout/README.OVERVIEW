A layout widget manages the layout of
its children within its window; it is
essentially a local window manager.

Layout widgets typically have a lot
of logic to handle requests to and
from their children but do little if
any actual pixel-painting on their
own behalf.

The x-kit layout widgets are designed
to be individually simple and freely
composable.
