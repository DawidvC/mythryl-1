This directory contains full source for the
compiler, plus various related applications.

My normal development cycle consists of doing
the following sequence of commands in the root
directory (.. -- that containing the INSTALL
file):

    make all                             # Or "make mythryl7" for just the core stuff.
    make self                            # Build the recompile-the-compiler bootstrap system.
    make fixpoint                        # Verify that the new compiler compiles itself properly.
    make seed; rm -rf bin; make tar      # Generate a new seed-libraries.tgz in the root directory,
                                         # and a new full sourcecode tarball suitable for
                                         # distribution, in the directory above the root directory.
