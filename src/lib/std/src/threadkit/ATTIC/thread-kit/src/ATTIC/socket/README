This is the threadkit implementation of the Sockets API.  The implementation
mostly follows that of the Lib7 version, but with a couple of exceptions:

  1) The systems calls ?? are executed with the timers disabled, since they
     may take much longer than a time quantum and there is no non-blocking
     form.

  2) The systems calls ?? are restarted if they are interrupted.

  3) Additional event-valued operations are added.
