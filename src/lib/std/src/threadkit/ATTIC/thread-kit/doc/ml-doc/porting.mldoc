<TITLE>Porting old programs</TITLE>

<SECTION>
<HEAD>Porting old threadkit programs</HEAD>

<PP>
There have been substantial changes from Version&nbsp;0.9.8 of &threadkit;.
Most of these changes are cosmetic name changes meant to track
changes in the &SML; interfaces, and to rationalize naming conventions.
In this section, we detail the changes to the &threadkit; interfaces, and
describe correspondence between the old and new interfaces.

<SECTION>
<HEAD>Backwards compatibility modules</HEAD>
<PP>
To ease the transition from version&nbsp;0.9.8 of &threadkit; to the new
interfaces, we provide two backwards compatibility modules in the
&threadkit; Library.

<HEAD>Input/output</HEAD>
<PP>
The most significant changes to the &threadkit; interfaces have to do with
input/output operations.
In version&nbsp;0.9.8, the package <IDREF/CIO/ provided an implementation
of the &SMLNJ; <IDREF/IO/ api extended with event-valued operations.
The old &SML; I/O interface has been replaced with a new interface, which is
described in the <DOCREF DOCUMENT=SML-BASIS-DOC/&SML; Basis Library Manual/,
and &threadkit; has followed suite.

<SECTION>
<HEAD>Polling</HEAD>
<PP>
The only loss in function from version&nbsp;0.9.8 is the elimination
of the <IDREF/poll/ operation, which provided a non-blocking form
of <VALREF STRID="threadkit"/sync/.
Instead of this operation, &threadkit; now provides non-blocking input operations
on many of the basic communication types.
