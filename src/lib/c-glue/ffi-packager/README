WHAT'S IN HERE
--------------

    This is a library for postprocessing SML code generated by C-GLUE-MAKER
to make it more SML-idiomatic.

FEATURES
--------

   1. Insert automatic type conversions, 
            Bool <-> int, String <-> (uchar,ro) ptr'
      etc.
   2. Convert functions using call by reference to return by value.
   3. Generate "nice" datatypes for enums 
   4. Generate accessors, mutators and constructors for structs/unions.
   5. Encode ``object oriented'' C types in ML types
   6. Generate code for #define

STATUS
------

   It's a mess and should be rewritten when I get a handle on what needs
to be in here.
