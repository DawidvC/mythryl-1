## block-placement.api

# Compiled by:
#     src/lib/compiler/lower/make7/lowcode.make6



#  Perform code block placement 

# When several blocks are successors to the unique entry node, 
# then block with the lowest block id appears first.
# This usually corresponds to what one wants when doing dynamic 
# code generation.



#            "The advantage of the experienced programmer is not
#             so much that he is better at solving difficult
#             problems -- although he usually is -- as that he
#             is better at avoiding them in the first place."
