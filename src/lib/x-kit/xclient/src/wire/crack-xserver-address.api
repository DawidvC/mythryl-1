## crack-xserver-address.api
#
# API for a little utility to analyse
# user-level X server specs.  This is
# basically dedicated support for
#
#     src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/display.pkg
#
# Our input string is a string containing a
# user-level X server name, often taken from
# a DISPLAY unix environment variable, something
# like:
#     ":0.0"
#     "unix:0.0"
#     "foo.com:0.0"
#     "192.168.0.0:0.0"
#
# This consists logically "hostname:display.screen".
# In the typical case where the host is the local
# machine, which has only one display with in turn
# only one logical screen (possibly spready across
# multiple monitors) this is likely to be something
# like
#     "127.0.0.1:0.0"
#     "unix:0.0"
#     ":0.0"
#
# We return a:
#
#    UNIX           address if the hostname part is empty or the string "unix".
#    INET_ADDR      address if the hostname starts with a digit
#    INET_HOSTNAME  address otherwise.
#
# We raise BAD_ADDRESS if display or screen values are not integers,
# or are otherwise malformed.
