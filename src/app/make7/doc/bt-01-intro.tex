\section{Introduction}

With the exception of the runtime system which is written in C
(about 10% of the compiler source code) the compiler and interactive
system are self-compiling.

However, there are a few important differences between compiling an
ordinary program using make7 and (re-)compiling the interactive system
itself.  These differences are handled by a special-purpose version of
the compilation manager: the bootstrap compiler.  Its interface is
{\tt package make_compiler}, exported from library {\tt \$ROOT/src/lib/core/make-compiler/current.make6}.

This document describes how to use the bootstrap compiler and also
explains how bootstrapping the compiler differs from compiling
ordinary code.
