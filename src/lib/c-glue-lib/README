This is the ML-NLFFI Library, the core of a new foreign-function
interface for lib7.

Library $c/c.make6 provides:

  - an encoding of the C type system in ML
  - dynamic linking (an interface to dlopen/dlsym)
  - ML/C string conversion routines

  This is the (only) library to be used by user code.

Library $c/c-internals.make6 (subdirectory "internals"):

  - implements all of $c/c.make6
  - implements low-level hooks to be used by c-glue-maker-generated code

Library $c/memory.make6 (subdirectory "memory"):

  - encapsulates low-level details related to raw memory access

  User code should NOT directly refer to this library.
