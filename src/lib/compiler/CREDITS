Mythryl is derived from SML/NJ, a project which has been in development
since about 1985 with major contributions by a large number of people,
initially mostly from Bell Labs, CMU, Cornell, Princeton, and Yale.

A partial list of contributors just through 1991
(in "Standard ML of New Jersey, Appel and MacQueen,
http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/papers/smlnj.ps)
included:

    Andrew W Appel and David B MacQueen:  Original co-designers and co-implementors of SML/NJ.
    John H Reppy: runtime, signal handling, call/cc, ffi, CML, eXene.
    Trevor Jim: CPS representation, match compiler, closure-converter, float library, external asm prims.
    Bruce F Duba: match compiler, CPS constant-folding, incline-expansion, spill, callcc, various.
    James W O'Toole: NS32032 code generator.
    Normal Ramsey: MIPS code generator.
    Andrew P Tolmach: SML/NJ debugger, pure-functional style static environments.
    Adam T Dingle: debugger's Emacs interface.
    James S Mattson: First Mythryl-lex implementation
    David R Tarditi: Production quality Mythryl-lex, plus Mythryl-yacc, debugger's type-reconstruction, ML-to-C compiler.
    Lal George: floating point support, debugging.
    Zhong Shao: Common subexpression eliminator, calle-save convention.
    Nick Rothwell, Mads Tofte: Initial separate compilation support.
    Gene Rollins: Improved separate compilation support.

The list of contributors since then is more or less co-extensive
with the list of authors of papers listed in ROOT/doc/references.
