## translate-codetree-to-target-machine.api --- translate codetrees to a flowgraph of target machine code.
#
# Codetree is the last machine-independent
# intermediate code representation used in
# the compiler; we translate it into the
# abstract instruction set of the target
# machine, which in turn will be translated
# into target machine assembly or machine
# language.

# Compiled by:
#     src/lib/compiler/lower/make7/lowcode.make6
