2006-11-29 CrT I seriously dislike a lot of the SmlTk terminology.

 'Configure' is a long verb which they are using as a noun.  REPLACE with 'Trait'.

More substitutions:

    'sel' -> 'get'
    'upd' -> 'set'
    'add' -> 'insert'
    'del' -> 'remove'

    'Binding' -> 'EventAction'

     'insertTextEnd' -> 'insertTextAtEnd'
     'clearText' -> 'deleteAllText'
     'readText' -> 'readTextRegion'
     'readTextAll' -> 'readAllText'

     'getTextWidWidgets' -> 'getAllToplevelTextWidgets'
     'getCanvasWidgets'  -> 'getAllToplevelCanvasWidgets'

     'getConf' -> 'getTrait'

     'CItem' -> 'CanvasItem'

For identifiers, we should have 'make-' and 'make_named-'
instead of 'new-' and 'mk-'.

And in general, all words should be spelled out, not abbreviated -- dammit!

I also wonder if a lot more implementation hiding wouldn't be apropos.

And why the f**k do we have to have
all these 'id' fields everywhere
instead of honest object pointers?!
