# 2007-10-04 CrT: I have the impression that the idea is that large_int
#                 should be the biggest integer implementation available:
#                 indefinite-precision if installed, otherwise the longest
#                 fixed-precision integer implementation.

# Compiled by:
#     src/lib/std/stdlib.make6

package large_int= large_int_imp;	# large_int_imp	is from   src/lib/std/src/bind-largeint-32.pkg
