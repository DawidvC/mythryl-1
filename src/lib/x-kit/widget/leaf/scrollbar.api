## scrollbar.api
#
#      "The scrollbar widget is used to indicate
#       a position and size, and to allow the user
#       to change the position.  Scrollbars are
#       most commonly used to specify the view a
#       windw gives on a logically much larger
#       display area, and to allow the user to
#       pan the window over the display area."

#     src/lib/x-kit/widget/leaf/slider.api
#
#
# size:
#     The size specified in the make() functions is
#     for the narrow dimension, and is treated as
#     tight -- the scrollbar's expressed size preference
#     is for no shrink or stretch in that dimension.
#     A zero or negative size value will raise BAD_ARG.
#
#     The scrollbar is arbitrarily elastic along the
#     long dimension.
#
# color:
#     The scrollbar thumb is drawn in the specified
#     color (defaults to black) on its parent's background
#     color.
#
# set_scrollbar_thumb:
#     The value displayed and controlled by the scrollbar
#     varies from 0.0 to 1.0 inclusive.  The set_scrollbar_thumb
#     function allows external code to control the scrollbar.
#     For example the call
#    
#         set_scrollbar_thumb
#             #	
#             scrollbar_widget
#             #	
#             { size => THE 0.2,	# Must have top + size < 1.0
#               top  => THE 0.5
#             }  
#     
#     sets the scrollbar cursor to be halfway up
#     the scrollbar gutter and to occupy one-fifth
#     of the gutter's length.
#
# scrollbar_change'_of:
#     Use this function to get the scrollbar_change'
#     mailop reporting scrollbar changes.  You MUST
#     read this mailop (typically using 'select' or
#     'do_mailop'):  If you do not, the scrollbar
#     impl will block, locking up the scrollbar.
