## expand-oop-syntax.api

# Compiled by:
#     src/lib/compiler/front/typechecker/typecheck.make6


# Mythryl treats OOP constructs as derived forms, expanding
# them into vanilla raw syntax during the parsing process.
# This minimizes added compiler complexity.  It also
# minimizes risk of complicating or compromising core semantics.
#
# This API is implemented by:
#
#     src/lib/compiler/front/typechecker/typecheck/expand-oop-syntax.pkg
