This directory contains a collection of example x-kit applications.
The application directories are:

  add		- a simple arithmetic game
  basicwin	- the trivial x-kit program
  bounce	- demonstrates concurrency
  bricks	- A translation of Luca Cardelli's Module-3 game
  calc		- a desk-top calculator
  get-display	- code to get the display string in x-kit format
  mixer		- a color mixer
  plaid		-
  triangle	- Draws a triangle each time you click the mouse.
  widgets	- miscellaneous widget examples

When loaded, each application has a function ``do_it'' which takes
a string argument specifying the server.  The empty string can
be used to indicate a local X server. In addition, there is a
``main'' function, which is suitable as an argument to spawn_to_disk.

For a tutorial on how to write library level x-kit code, you should
start by looking at basicwin, which is an x-kit version of an example
from Vol. 1 of the O'Reilly X-window System books.

More substantial examples can be found in the demos directory.
