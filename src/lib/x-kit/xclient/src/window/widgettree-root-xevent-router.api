## widgettree-root-xevent-router.api
#
# At the root of each widget hierarchy we need
# a thread which accepts xevents from xsession
# xbuf-to-topwindow-xevent-router and then passes
# them on down the widgettree.  That's our job here.
#
# For the big picture see the diagram in
#     src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/xsession.pkg

# Compiled by:
