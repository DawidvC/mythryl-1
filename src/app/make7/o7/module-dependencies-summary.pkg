# Mythryl source module_dependencies_summarys.
#
#   Module_Dependencies_Summarys abstract from a source file just
#   the information needed by the make7 dependency
#   analysis code -- which is to say, essentially,
#   the external modules and symbols references.
#
#   This abstraction makes them much shorter,
#   and hence much quicker to re-read from disk.
#
# XXX BUGGO FIXME   Should we rename to something
#                   more informative like 'module_dependencies'?
