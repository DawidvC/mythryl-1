   + Made change to the representation of string0 in the runtime system so
     that it always point to a null terminated string (instead of ML unit).
     This way, passing an ML string to the C world is much simplified (only
     one instruction!).

03/09/2002 Allen <leunga@dorsai.org>

   + Added c-ext.{sig,sml} and light-weight reference parameter passing.
     Gtk, SDL, OpenGL and mysql now use this mechanism.
   + We now require the new rawrecord, rawupdatexxx, rawselectxxx 
     primops.

03/05/2002 Allen <leunga@dorsai.org>

   + Inlining optimizations added to ffi-packager.  
     Code size is now 28% smaller for gtk

03/05/2002 Allen <leunga@dorsai.org>

   + cvs tag: release_0_1_3

03/04/2002 Allen <leunga@dorsai.org>

   + Gtk: added a simple ItemFactory class for building menus.

03/03/2002 Allen <leunga@dorsai.org>

   + ffi-transforms added.  These are a bunch of type-based program
     transformations on C program.
   + Fixed up the parameter passing of OpenGL functions
   + Added more stuff to GtkGadgets.
   + Added my own Signed and Unsiged integer types.  These will override
     the default.

02/28/2002 Allen <leunga@dorsai.org> 

   + Started version 0.1.3
   + Improved the set of C -> ML transformations
   + Added #include <SDL/SDL_opengl.h> to SDL
 
02/22/2002 Allen <leunga@dorsai.org> 

   + Added OpenGL

02/18/2002 Allen <leunga@dorsai.org> 

   + Upgraded to c-glue-maker v0.9

02/17/2002 Allen <leunga@dorsai.org> 



    + Added the Gadget library, which is a more convenient layer on top of
      the base Gtk library

    + Improved FFI-Packager.  Now it is possible to automatically generate
      a call-by-value ML function

        val gtk_label_get.f : 'a GtkLabel -> string

      from the call-by-reference C function

       void gtk_label_get(GtkLabel *, char **)

      We generate the following code:

      fun f x1 =
          let val vx2 = C.new' (C.S.ptr : (uchar, rw) ptr C.S.size)
              val x2 = c::ptr::enref' vx2
              val () = f' (x1, x2)
              val x2 = C.Get.ptr' vx2
              val () = C.discard' vx2
              val x2 = ZString.toML' x2
          in x2
          end

    + By default all type info are now stripped from the libraries.
      We only retain type info for array subscripting.

    + By default all functions with leading underscores are now filtered out.

02/16/2002 Allen <leunga@dorsai.org> 

    + version 0.1.1 started
    + added expat (James Clark's XML parser)
      Need work to make it useable.

02/16/2002 Allen <leunga@dorsai.org> 

    +  Last minute c-glue-maker incompatibities fix.

02/15/2002 Allen <leunga@dorsai.org> 

    +  Released version 0.1 (alpha) onto my webpage
  
02/01/2002 Allen <leunga@dorsai.org> 

    -  gnome compilation dies with missing ST__GtkButton.  Looks like 
       a c-glue-maker bug.

    -  wchar compilation fails because the name clashes in 
       functions __mbrlen and mbrlen. 

    +  Fixed wchar compilation: __mbrlen is now named as f__mbrlen in ML.

    -  orbit fails to compile.  
       Ckit bug in handling constant 0xffffffff

    -  Generated macros from #define's contain underfined references
       to variables. 
   
    -  unicode generated code fails to compile in ML.
       Constant too large



02/09/2002 Allen <leunga@dorsai.org> 

    +  VERSION 0.1 

    +  Started combining all the c-glue-maker generated libraries together

    -  Problems combining various libs together because of name 
       conflicts/duplicates of S_0, U_1 and IS__IO_FILE etc.

    -  mysql (and many other libraries) need long long to function
