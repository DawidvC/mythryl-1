## signals.pkg

# Compiled by:
#     src/lib/std/src/stdlib-core.make6

# These are the two basic interfaces to the run-time system signals support.
# The interface covers the basic signals operations, plus a small collection
# of standard signals that should be portable to non-UNIX systems.

# This package gets extended by:
#     src/lib/std/src/unix/unix-signals.pkg

					# internal_signals	is from   src/lib/std/src/nj/internal-signals.pkg
