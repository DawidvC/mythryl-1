This is an "beta" release of a completely new implementation of threadkit.
It has been in use since the Fall'96, and seems to be robust.
The doc/html directory has partial HTML documentation for this version.

This version of threadkit has a number of changes in the API.
See the file doc/html/porting.html for more information.
