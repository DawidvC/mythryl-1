SML Namings for MySQL 3.2x
===========================
 
This library talks to your MySQL server.

REQUIREMENTS
============

  You must have the following installed:

1. sml/nj 110.35 or later, but don't use 110.36 on x86 
       (unless it's the version in CVS)
   sml should be in your PATH.

2. Matthias Blume's c-glue-lib and c-glue-maker.
   c-glue-maker should be in your PATH.
   Note that currently this is only supported on the Sparc and x86.

3. gcc 2.96 or later

4. mysql 3.23 or later 3.xx version, including developmental header files and
   shared libraries.

INSTALLATION
============

   Run the script build with no arguments.  This will extract the proper
   definitions from your C header files and build the library.

   If everything terminates properly then you're set.  Otherwise, 
   something is wrong.  If so, please send me email for a repro of the 
   problem. 

USING THE LIBRARY
=================

   To be filled in...

   In the meantime, just look at the api file mysql.sig.
   The stuff should be mostly self-explanatory.
