\section{Listing of all make7-specific environment variables}

Most control parameters that affect make7's operation can be adjusted
using environment variables $v_s$ at startup time, i.e, when the {\tt
sml} command is invoked.  Each such parameter has a default setting.
Default settings are determined at bootstrap time, i.e., the time when
the heap image for the compiler's interactive system is
built.  At bootstrap time, it is possible to
adjust defaults by using a set of environment variables $v_b$.  In the
current version of make7 it is always the case that $v_s = v_b$.  (In
older versions this was not the case.) If neither $v_s$ nor $v_b$ were
set, a hard-wired fallback value will be used.

The rule for constructing the name $v_s$ (and $v_b$) is the
following: For each adjustable parameter $x$ there is a {\em name
stem}.  If the stem for $x$ is $s$, then $v_s = v_b = \mbox{\tt CM\_}s$.

Since the normal installation procedure for the compiler sets some of the
$v_b$ variables at bootstrap time, there are two columns with default
values in the following table.  The value labeled {\em fallback} is
the one that would have been used had there been no environment
variable at bootrap time, the one labeled {\em default} is the one the
user will actually see.

To save space, the table lists the stem but not the names for its
associated (longer) $v_s$ and $v_b$.  For example, since the the table
shows {\tt VERBOSE} in the row for {\tt make7.control.verbose}.

\begin{center}
\begin{small}
\begin{tabular}{@{}l||c|c|c|c|p{1.6in}@{}}
{\tt make7.control.}$c$ & stem & type & fallback & default & default's meaning \\
\hline \hline
{\tt verbose} & {\tt VERBOSE} & {\tt Bool} & {\tt true} & same & issue
progess messages \\
{\tt debug} & {\tt DEBUG} & {\tt Bool} & {\tt false} & same & do not
issue debug messages \\
{\tt keep\_going} & {\tt KEEP\_GOING} & {\tt Bool} & {\tt false} &
same & quit on first error \\
(none) & {\tt PATHCONFIG} & {\tt String} & see below & see below &
central path configuration file \\
{\tt parse\_caching} & {\tt PARSE\_CACHING} & {\tt int} & {\tt 100} &
same & at most 100 parse trees will be cached in main memory \\
(none) & {\tt LOCAL\_PATHCONFIG} & {\tt String} & see below & same &
user-specific path configuration file \\
{\tt warn\_obsolete} & {\tt WARN\_OBSOLETE} & {\tt Bool} & {\tt true}
& same & issue warnings about obsolete C-style operators in
description files \\
{\tt conserve\_memory} & {\tt CONSERVE\_MEMORY} & {\tt Bool} & {\tt
false} & same & avoid repeated I/O operations by keeping certain
information in main memory
\end{tabular}
\end{small}
\end{center}

The fallback for {\tt PATHCONFIG} is {\tt /usr/lib/smlnj-pathconfig},
but the standard installation overrides this and uses {\tt
\$INSTALL_DIR/lib/pathconfig} (where {\tt \$INSTALL_DIR} is the compiler
installation directory) instead.

The default for the ``local'' path configuration file is {\tt
.smlnj-pathconfig}. This file is located in the user's home directory
(given by the environment variable {\tt \$HOME}).

Control parameters can also be set using command-line parameters (see
section~\REF{sec:cmdline}).
