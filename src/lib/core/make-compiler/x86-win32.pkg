###                   "Dear Doctor Walker: I thank you ever so much for
###                    the impulse which moved you to write the article --
###                    and for the article, also, which is mighty good reading.
###
###                   "And I am glad you praised Kipling -- he deserves it; he
###                    deserves all the praise that is lavished upon him, and more.
###
###                   "It is marvelous -- the work which that boy has done. The more
###                    you read the 'Jungle Books' the more wonderful they grow.
###
###                   "But Kipling himself does not appreciate them as he ought;
###                    he read 'Tom Sawyer' a couple of times when he was coming
###                    up out of his illness and said he would rather be author
###                    of that book than any that has been published during its lifetime.
###
###                   "Now, I could have chosen better, I should have chosen 'Jungle Books.'
###                    But I prize his compliment just the same, of course.
###
###                   "I thank you again and heartily. I haven't the language
###                    to say it strongly enough."
###
###                                                    -- Mark Twain, 1899
