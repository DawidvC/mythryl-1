This is the first pre-release/alpha version of what we shall call x-kit 2.0,
which is based on the "fifth pre-release version of x-kit 1.0" (see README-1.0
for details). This version offers a few enhancements to this previous release,
including improved X authorization code, improved support for working with
X resources (eg, .xrdb files), some widget deadlock-avoidance code, and support
for receiving window deletion events from the X window manager. More such updates
are to come (we promise!), but this release is provided in case x-kit users wish
to take advantage of a few of these features early. Because of a few API changes
(see CHANGES for details) and more upcoming improvements, we have named this
release x-kit 2.0a. Please feel free to contact us with any bug reports, 
suggestions, or critiques.
