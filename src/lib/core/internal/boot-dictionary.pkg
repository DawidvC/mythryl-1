## boot-dictionary.pkg

# Compiled by:

# Run the boot_dictionary_g generic which builds the boot dictionaries.
#
# It is important that this generic is done executing by the time
# the mythryld main package code (src/lib/core/internal/main.pkg)
# runs:  Otherwise, we would never be able to get rid of make7/make_compiler
# from an interactive heap image.

###                    When we had completed the details,
###                    we rewrote everything so that no
###                    one could tell how we came upon
###                    our ideas or why. This is the
###                    standard in mathematics."
