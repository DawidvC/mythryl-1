# at initialization or termination time.  We define five distinct contexts
# for a hook:
#
#	FORK_TO_DISK	just prior to exporting a heap image (fork_to_disk).
#	SPAWN_TO_DISK	exit because of spawn_to_disk.
#	SHUTDOWN		normal program exit.
#	STARTUP		initialization of a program that was generated by fork_to_disk.
#	APP_STARTUP	initialization of a program that was generated by spawn_to_disk.
