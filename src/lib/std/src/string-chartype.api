## string-chartype.api
#
# Predicates on characters.  This is modelled after the Unix C libraries.  
# Each predicate comes in two forms; one that works on integers, and one
# that works on an arbitrary character in a string.  The meanings of these
# predicates are documented in Section 3 of the Unix manual.
