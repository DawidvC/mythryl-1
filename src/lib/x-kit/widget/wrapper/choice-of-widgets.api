## choice-of-widgets.api
#
# Manage a list of widgets
# only one of which is visible
# at any given time.
#
# The shape and size preferences of
# this widget are identical to those
# of its currently visible child.
#
# The internal widget list is addressed via
# integer index values; the first widget is
# number zero.
#
# This list of widgets may be dynamically
# altered via the insert(), append() and
# delete() functions, whose semantics
# match those of in Line_Of_Widgets.			# Line_Of_Widgets	is from   src/lib/x-kit/widget/layout/line-of-widgets.api
#     The length, contents and order of
# the widget list do not change except as
# explicitly requested by the user via
# these functions.
#
# If the choice_of_widgets childlist is
# empty, is behaves as a transparent
# one-pixel-square widget.
