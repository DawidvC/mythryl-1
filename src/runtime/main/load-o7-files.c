/* load-o7-files.c
 *
 * This file implements the core Lib7 linker functionality
 * which combines oh7_files to produce a Lib7 "executable"
 * (actually a heap image which can be run via bin/runtime7).
 *
 * Our primary entrypoint is
 *      load_oh7_files(),
 * which is invoked from src/runtime/main/main.c:main()
 * when runtime7 is given the "--runtime-o7-files-to-load=filename"
 * commandline switch, where the "filename"
 * parameter is the name of a file containing a
 * list of filenames of the .o7 files to load, one per line. 
 * (Some "oh7_files" may in fact be at some given offset inside
 * a library archive file, in which case the syntax gets a bit involved.)
 *
 * Bootstrapping a fresh Lib7 install is accomplished by
 * including in the source distribution a set of libraries
 * (in "seed-libraries.x86-unix.tgz" or equivalent)
 * sufficient to build the Lib7 compiler proper plus
 * essential related tools such as the parser generator.
 * (Also included is the required OH7_FILES_TO_LOAD file.)
 *
 * We create the seed-libraries.x86-unix.tgz tarball
 * and then a full source distribution tarball by doing
 *     make self
 *     make fixpoint
 *     make seed
 *     make tar 
 * in a fully installed system, thus closing the circle.

/*
 * LINK ENVIRONMENT:
 *
 * At link-time, the "known universe" consists of the set
 * of already-loaded .o7 files.

 * For our purposes, each such .o7 file is named by
 * its "picklehash", which is a 16-byte hash of its
 * "pickled" (i.e, serialized as a bytestring) form.
 *
 * After being linked in, each such oh7_file returns
 * a tree of records representing its exported, externally-visible
 * functions, global variables and so forth:  This tree
 * constitutes everything we know about that oh7_file at
 * linktime.
 *
 * It follows that any item of interest known to the linker can be
 * named by a picklehash P plus a sequence of integers I0,I1...In,
 * which correspond to the recipe:
 *
 *     Look up the export tree for the already-loaded
 *     oh7_file named by picklehash P, then take
 *     the I0-th entry from that's tree's root record,
 *     the I1-th entry from the preceding result,
 *     ...
 *     and return the In-th entry from -that- result.
 *
 * Thus, every reference by one oh7_file to an external
 * value from some other oh7_file must ultimately be
 * expressed by such a (P, I0, I1, ... In) sequence.

 *  e+c+p+r+l+h  -  END OF .O7 FILE
 *
 * IMPORT TREE FORMAT description:
 *
 *  The import tree area contains a list of key-value pairs
 *  where the keys are picklehashes and the values are trees.
 *
 *  Each picklehash key names an external .o7 file which
 *  this oh7_file references -- calling its functions,
 *  reading its global variables, whatever.
 *
 *  The set of 'j' such values needed as imports from P by
 *  our current oh7_file will form a list looking like
 *      P, I0,0 I0,1 ...  In,
 *      P  I1,0 I1,1 ...  Im 
 *      ...
 *      P  Ij,0 Ij,1 ...  Ip
 *  All of them will begin with P and often I0 will equal
 *  I1 or such:  If we merge all such common prefixes, we
 *  convert the list into a tree.  This is the tree
 *  associated with a given picklehash in the import area.
 *
 *  Trees are constructed according to the following Lib7-enum:
 *    enum tree = NODE of (int * tree) list
 *  Leaves in this tree have the form (NODE []).
 *  Trees are written recursively -- (NODE l) is represented by n (= the
 *  length of l) followed by n (int * node) subcomponents.  Each component
 *  consists of the integer selector followed by the corresponding tree.
 *
 *  The size of the import tree area is only given implicitly. When reading
 *  this area, the reader must count the number of leaves and compare it
 *  with number_of_imported_picklehashes.
 *
 *  Integer values in the import tree area (lengths and selectors) are
 *  written in "packed" integer format. In particular, this means that
 *  Values in the range 0..127 are represented by only 1 byte.
 *  Conceptually, the following pickling routine is used:
 *
 *    void recur_write_ul (unsigned long l, FILE *file)
 *    {
 *        if (l != 0) {
 *            recur_write_ul (l >> 7, file);
 *            putc ((l & 0x7f) | 0x80, file);
 *        }
 *    }
 *
 *    void write_ul (unsigned long l, FILE *file)
 *    {
 *        recur_write_ul (l >> 7, file);
 *        putc (l & 0x7f, file);
 *    }
 *
 * CODE AREA FORMAT description:
 *
 *  The code area contains multiple code segements.  There will be at least
 *  two.  The very first segment is the "data" segment -- responsible for
 *  creating literal constants on the heap.  The idea is that code in the
 *  data segment will be executed only once at link-time. Thus, it can
 *  then be garbage-collected immediately. (In the future it is possible that
 *  the data segment will not contain executable code at all but some form
 *  of bytecode that is to be interpreted separately.)
 *
 *  In the .o7 file, each code segment is represented by its size s and its
 *  entry point offset (in bytes -- written as 4-byte big-endian integers)
 *  followed by s bytes of machine- (or byte-) code. The total length of all
 *  code segments (including the bytes spent on representing individual sizes
 *  and entry points) is bytes_of_compiled_code.  The entrypoint field for the
 *  data segment is currently ignored (and should be 0).
 *
 * LINKING CONVENTIONS:
 *
 *  Linking is achieved by executing all code segments in sequential order.
 *
 *  The first code segment (i.e., the "data" segment) receives unit as
 *  its single argument.
 *
 *  The second code segment receives a record as its single argument.
 *  This record has (number_of_imported_picklehashes+1) components.
 *  The first number_of_imported_picklehashes components correspond
 *  to the leaves of the import trees.  The final
 *  component is the result from executing the data segment.
 *
 *  All other code segments receive a single argument which is the result
 *  of the preceding segment.
 *
 *  The result of the last segment represents the exports of the compilation
 *  unit.  It is to be paired up with the export picklehash and stored in the
 *  linking dictionary.  If there is no export picklehash, then the final result
 *  will be thrown away.
 *
 *  The import trees are used for constructing the argument record for the
 *  second code segment.  The picklehash at the root of each tree is the key for
 *  looking up a value in the existing dynamic environment.  In general,
 *  that value will be a record.  The selector fields of the import tree
 *  associated with the picklehash are used to recursively fetch components
 *  of that record.
