This directory contains the main IR used by the lowcode optimizer.
The IR is mainly concerned with control flow and control dependence.
The IR contains the control_flow_graph, (post-)dominator tree, control depenence graph,
loop (interval) package, plus other facets.  

This IR is quite different from the cluster enum, which is used by the basic
lowcode system.  In any case the cluster and the control_flow_graph are interconvertible.
