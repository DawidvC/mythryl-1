#  The [[fileOpened]] field contains the name of the file that was opened   
#  to produce a particular [[Input_Source]].                                
#  It is used only to derive related file names.                            
#  (For an example, see [[compile_g::codeopt]] and [[compile_g::parse]] in    
#  \texttt { build/compile-g.pkg }.)                                          
#                                                                           
#  [[make_source]] has some old warts build in.  It takes as argument a       
#  file and line number, and it assumes column-1.  The reason we don't      
#  simply pass a [[source_map::sourcemap]] is that we have to hide the        
#  Awful truth about the beginning position according to mythryl-lex (it's-2).   
#  That position, and therefore the creation of the source map, are         
#  encapsulated inside [[make_source]].                                       
#                                                                           
#  [[filepos]] is kept around for historical reasons, to avoid having to    
#  Change lots of code elsewhere in the compiler; it wraps a                
#  Call to [[source_map::filepos]] and massages the return type.              
#  It probably should be eliminated, but then somebody would have to fix    
#  All those call sites.                                                    
#
