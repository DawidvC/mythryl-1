###                         like Perl or Python, say, are suddenly more

# Calling 'multiline' on a regex
# returns a clone of it with its
# internal 'multiline' flag set to TRUE.
#
# Calling 'singleline' on a regex
# returns a clone of it with its
# internal 'multiline' flag set to FALSE.
#
# The only difference is that when
# multiline is set to TRUE,
# ^ and $ match newlines in the
# string, otherwise they match
# only the absolute start and
# end of the string.
