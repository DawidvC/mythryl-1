# This is a generic module for computing the control dependence graph
# from a graph with an entry and an exit.  
# The graph is treated as a control flow graph.  
# The edge predicate is used to determine whether an edge should be
# treated as a branch edge.

###            "Mostly, when you see programmers, they aren't doing anything.
###             One of the attractive things about programmers is that you
###             cannot tell whether or not they are working simply by looking
###             at them.
###
###             Very often they're sitting there seemingly drinking coffee and
###             gossiping, or just staring into space. What the programmer is
###             trying to do is get a handle on all the individual and unrelated
###             ideas that are scampering around in his head."
