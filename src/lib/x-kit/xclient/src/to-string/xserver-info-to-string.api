## xserver-info-to-string.api
#
# When we connect to an X server, we get back a
# huge blob of information which gets decoded by
#
#     wire_to_value::decode_connect_request_reply ()
#
# Here we translate the resulting value into a
# human-readable string.

# Compiled by:
#     src/lib/x-kit/xclient/xclient-internals.make6
