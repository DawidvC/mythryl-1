## virtual-terminal.api
#
# A simple virtual terminal built on top of the text widget;
# it supports an interface that is compatible with the file
# package in threadkit.
#
# Compare to:
#     src/lib/x-kit/widget/text/one-line-virtual-terminal.api
#
#
#         "The virtual terminal widget provides a simple
#          way to support traditional IO stream-based
#          applications. It is implemented on top of the
#          text widget, adding a device driver for the
#          keyboard and the instream/outstream interface.
#          [...]
#         "Writing on the outstream displays text in the
#          window.  User input is line-buffered; it is
#          only available on the instream after the user
#          has types a carriage return ("\m") or newline
#          ("\n").  An input line can be edited, with
#          backspace ("\h") and delete ("\127") erasing
#          the previously input character.  Tab characters
#          are not handled correctly, nor does the
#          [virtual_terminal] provide a visible cursor."
