The principal file here is cd.grm.
c.grm and d.grm are derived from it via cpp and should not be edited.

For C:
 1. comment out DPARSE.define
 2. /lib/cpp -P cd.grm > c.grm

For D:
 1. uncomment DPARSE.define
 2. /lib/cpp -P cd.grm > d.grm

Note: "-P" so that don't get control info (e.g. # 218 "cd.grm").
