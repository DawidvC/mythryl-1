# PRINT_PACKAGE: prints a package which includes a value 'table' and a
# package 'table' whose api matches LR_TABLE.  The table in the printed
# package will contain the same information as the one passed to
# printStruct, although the representation may be different.  It returns
# the number of entries left in the table after compaction.
  
# Compiled by:
#     src/app/yacc/src/Mythryl-Yacc.make6

    package lr_table:  Lr_Table;		# Lr_Table	is from   src/app/yacc/lib/base.api
