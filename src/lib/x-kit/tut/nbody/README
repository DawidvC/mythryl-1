This is a very simple (and simple-minded) N-body simulation.
It produces a window showing some solar system similar to ours
(but with TWO Jupiters that are a LOT heavier than the real one!).

The point of this code is to show off concurrency:
You can resize the window, change the setting of the magnification slider,
or grab the canvas and shift it around all while the display continues
to show the spinning planets and updating positions according to both
the state of the simulation and the input of the user.

Otherwise this code is pretty bad as far as N-body simulations are
concerned: It is probably numerically unstable to begin with but also
fails to adjust sampling rates in cases where planets move really
fast.  The result is a quick detoriation of the situation with planets
soon flying out of the system at hyperbolic speed.  But it is fun to
watch... :)

To run:
  In 110.0.x (old CM):
    - fire up mythryld
    - say CM.make ();
    - say main.run ();
  In 110.33 and later (new CM):
    - fire up mythryld
    - say CM.make "Makefile.make6";
    - say main.run ();

In either system, after you say CM.make you can also produce a
stand-alone heap image:
    - say lib7.spawn_to_disk ("nbody", main.AnimateSim.main);

With 110.33 and later you can also do this instead (from the shell prompt):

   bin/build-an-executable-mythryl-heap-image Makefile.make6 main.AnimateSim.main nbody

After you have built the heap image, you can run it just like any
host system executable.  (The top of the file contains a shebang
line invoking the bin/runtime7 program which actually loads and
executes it.)

Enjoy!

PS: The code is currently known to cause a segmentation violation on
    X86, probably due to a compiler bug.
