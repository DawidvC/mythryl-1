2010-03-08-22.00.01: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/color/xrgb.api: Make Xrgb type opaque. Add to_int(), from_int(), same().
2010-03-08-21.21.20: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/color/hue-saturation-value.api: Add to_floats() and from_floats() calls.
2010-03-08-21.01.40: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/color/rgb.api: Make exported Rgb type opaque; add from_unts(), to_unts() and same().
2010-03-08-19.20.26: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/color/: Establish rgb.api, rgb.pkg;  move Rgb definition over from src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/xtypes.pkg.
2010-03-08-19.01.22: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/xtypes.pkg: Drop Xrgb type altogether, redirecting all references to xrgb.pkg.

2010-03-08-13.08.09: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/: mkdir color/, cp stuff/color* color, split color.api -> hue-saturation-value.api + yiq.api.
2010-03-08-12.18.57: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/: Create to-string/, mv stuff/*to-string* into it.
2010-03-07-22.18.16: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/stuff/xclient-unit-test.pkg: exercise_window_stuff: Check assumption that root visual is depth=24 red/green/blue masks FF0000/00FF00/0000FF, and bypass unit tests if not.
2010-03-07-21.51.27: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/stuff/xserver-info-to-string.pkg:  Improve formatting. (Considerably!)  src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/value-to-wire.api: encode_create_window: Rename io -> io_class for clarity.  src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/window-io.api: create_window: Rename io -> io_class for clarity and consistency.  src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/xtypes.pkg: Rename Input_Output -> Io_Class for clarity and consistency.
2010-03-07-11.41.03: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/xsocket.pkg:  Top-of-file motivational comments.
2010-03-06-20.17.09: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/stuff/xclient-unit-test.pkg: Now actually creates a visible window! :-) :-) :-)
2010-03-05-21.40.52: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/draw-types.api: WINDOW: Renamed id -> window_id for clarity and consistency.
2010-03-05-21.17.30: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/value-to-wire.api: Rename window -> window_id various places for clarity and consistency.
2010-03-05-20.03.19: For clarity and consistency, in src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/window-io.api: create_window: Renamed id, parent -> window_id, parent_id.  In src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/value-to-wire.api: encode_create_window: Renamed window, parent -> window_id, parent_id.
2010-03-05-19.16.13: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/: For clarity and consistency rename xevent-to-topwindow-router.pkg ->  xsocket-to-topwindow-router.pkg, widgettree-root-xevent-router.pkg -> topwindow-to-widget-router.pkg. Break out xsocket-to-topwindow-router.api as a separate file.
2010-03-05-18.40.04: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/: Renamed xbuf-to-widgettree-xevent-router.pkg -> xevent-to-topwindow-router.pkg for conciseness, perhaps slightly improved clarity.
2010-03-05-03.51.27: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/xsocket.pkg: Cleaning and commenting.
2010-03-05-01.44.23: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/xsocket.pkg: outbuf_imp: loop() was ignoring max_bytes_per_socket_write, clearly a bug: Fixed.  Much commenting.
2010-03-04-18.41.30: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/xsocket.api: Renamed   exception LOST_REPLAY  ->   exception LOST_REPLY.  (I think the former was my typo in the heat of battle... *blush*)
2010-03-04-00.43.08: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/display.api: XSCREEN: Renamed black,white -> black_pixel,white_pixel for clarity and consistency.
2010-03-04-00.27.45: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/stuff/xclient-unit-test.pkg: Successful (and plausible) call to v2w::encode_create_window.
2010-03-03-23.28.23: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/value-to-wire.api: encode_create_window, encode_change_window_attributes: Change attributes arg from xt::Value_List -> List( xt::wa::Window_Attribute );  Make make_window_attribute_list private to value-to-wire.pkg.
2010-03-03-22.56.00: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/window-io.api: Move Window_Attribute to src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/xtypes.pkg, move make_window_attribute_list -> src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/value-to-wire.api.
2010-03-03-22.17.10: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/window.pkg: Rename std_xevent_mask -> standard_xevent_mask.
2010-03-03-21.51.16: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/value-to-wire.api:  encode_create_window, encode_change_window_attributes: Rename vals -> attributes for clarity.
2010-03-03-20.27.16: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/xtypes.pkg: Renamed VALMASK,VALS -> VALUE_MASK, VALUE_LIST for clarity and consistency with X protocol docs.
2010-03-03-20.27.16: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/window-io.api: Renamed Xwin_Val -> Window_Attribute because the latter is not gibberish.
2010-03-03-20.27.16: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/window.api: make_simple_top_window, make_simple_subwindow, make_transient_window, make_simple_popup_window: Renamed parameters geometry,border,background -> site,border_color,background_color for clarity.
2010-03-03-19.48.31: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/xtypes.pkg: Add Visual_Id_Choice = SAME_VISUAL_AS_PARENT | OVERRIDE_PARENT_VISUAL Visual_Id.  src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/window-io.api: create_window: Change visual_id from Null_Or(Visual_ID) -> Visual_Id_Choice, thus changing typical argument from NULL to the more readable SAME_VISUAL_AS_PARENT.
2010-03-03-16.49.17: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/window-io.ap: create_window: Renamed input_only -> io; replaced gibberish values NULL/THE TRUE/THE FALSE by INPUT_ONLY/INPUT_OUTPUT/SAME_IO_AS_PARENT.
2010-03-03-16.27.08: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/geometry.pkg: For concision renamed Window_Footprint, WINDOW_FOOTPRINT -> Window_Site, WINDOW_SITE.
2010-03-03-12.30.50: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/value-to-wire.api: encode_create_window: Rename id -> visual_id for clarity.
2010-03-03-12.04.00: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/xtypes.pkg: For clarity, change VISUAL.id -> VISUAL.visual_id.
2010-03-03-01.29.58: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/display.pkg: Dusty Deboer had ad-hoc retry logic hammered in on X-server connect and read-reply. Removed the former; naive retry will not work for connect() anyhow.  Replaced the latter (which is in fact needed due to 50Hz SIGALRM generating EINTRs in recv.c) with better-written pre-existing retry_syscall_on_eintr code.
2010-03-02-03.14.36: src/runtime/c-libs/lib7-c.h: Tweaked RAISE_SYSERR and RAISE_ERROR to correctly report both file and line number (e.g., foo.c:13 instead of just foo.c) for C-originated Mythryl exceptions.
2010-03-02-02.30.30: src/lib/std/src/threadkit/unix/: Renamed syscall.pkg -> retry-syscall-on-eintr.pkg -- because that is what it does. :-) 
2010-03-01-18.23.35: src/lib/std/src/threadkit/unix/: Renamed syscall.pkg -> retry-syscall-on-eintr.pkg -- because that is what it does. :-) 
2010-03-01-18.23.35: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/display.api: For clarity, renamed XSCREEN.root -> XSCREEN.root_window_id.
2010-03-01-17.37.55: src/lib/x-kit/widget/basic/root-window.pkg: For clarity rename ROOT_WINDOW.next_id -> ROOT_WINDOW.next_widget_id.
2010-03-01-17.26.51: src/lib/x-kit/widget/basic/root-window.pkg: For clarity and consistency rename ROOT_WINDOW.make_id -> ROOT_WINDOW.next_id :-)
2010-03-01-17.13.47: src/lib/x-kit/widget/basic/root-window.pkg: For clarity rename ROOT_WINDOW.id_fn -> ROOT_WINDOW.make_id, since that is what it does.
2010-03-01-16.14.36: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/: Created xsession.api -- kinda crazy for a module as big as xsession.pkg to have no explicit API definition.
2010-03-01-14.52.35: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/stuff/xclient-unit-test.pkg: Cleanly close tracelog at end, using new tracing::currently_tracing_to() fn.
2010-03-01-12.54.56: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/lib/tracing.api: Added currently_tracing_to () fn.
2010-02-28-23.38.55: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/display.pkg: Consistently report X server connection failures via XSERVER_CONNECT_ERROR exception, and attempt to be more clear about the problem.  src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/stuff/xclient-unit-test.pkg: Trap XSERVER_CONNECT_ERROR cleanly, report it, and abort all remaining xclient unit tests.
2010-02-28-22.36.46: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/xcore.api and elsewhere: Renamed BAD_ADDRESS -> XSERVER_CONNECT_ERROR for clarity.
2010-02-28-20.58.03: Changed *.LOAD_LOG -> *.load.log to further reduce the shouting.
2010-02-28-20.34.43: Generate foo.make6.index files instead of foo.make6.INDEX files, to reduce the shouting.
2010-02-28-16.34.25: For improved clarity, globally changed foo.make6.a7 freezefile names to foo.make6.frozen.
2010-02-28-15.30.34: Generate .compile.log files instead of .COMPILE_LOG files -- got tired of the shouting.
2010-02-28-14.42.34: Makefile: Added rest-a7-clean target to remove the freezefiles (.a7 files) created by doing make rest.
2010-02-26-22.31.12: Backed out all those proactive EINTR retries pending better understanding -- see discussion at bottom of src/runtime/c-libs/lib7-socket/connect.c
2010-02-26-21.30.16: Quite a bit of fiddling. In particular: src/runtime/c-libs/lib7-socket/hexdump-if.c: Wrote this to provide classic hex+ascii tracelogging of socket traffic.  src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/stuff/xclient-unit-test.pkg: Changed this to pass authentication info to open_xdisplay; now succeeds in contacting X server and decoding connect request reply. Also did some fiddling to make authentication.pkg visible and usable both inside and outside xclient library, and to get type sharing right.
2010-02-24-03.11.51: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/xauthentication.(api,pkg): Commenting.
2010-02-23-23.44.26: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/xauthentication.(api,pkg): Commenting.
2010-02-23-22.26.32: src/runtime/c-libs/: More proactive EINTR retries. NB: JHReppy emailed that not retrying on EINTR at the C level was a deliberate SML/NJ design decision. Fair enough, although it makes my hair stand on end.
2010-02-23-12.33.18: src/runtime/c-libs/posix-os/poll.c: Proactively handle EINTR. Change wahtever -> whatever in previous fixes, also status == -1 to status < 0, which seems traditional for some reason.
2010-02-23-04.18.29: src/runtime/c-libs/posix-io/: Proactively handle EINTR in close.c, dup2.c, dup.c, fcntl_d.c, fcntl_gfd.c, fcntl_gfl.c, fcntl_l_64.c, fcntl_l.c, fcntl_sfd.c, fcntl_sfl.c, readbuf.c, read.c, writebuf.c, write.c.
2010-02-23-03.51.55: src/runtime/c-libs/posix-filesys/: Proactively handle EINTR errors in openf.c, ftruncate.c, ftruncate_64.c.
2010-02-23-03.21.54: src/runtime/c-libs/lib7-socket/connect.c: Added a select() loop to handle EINTR during connect(), per Unix Network Programming p452.
2010-02-23-02.10.44: src/runtime/c-libs/lib7-socket/: Proactively add retries on EINTR to various calls because with a 50HZ SIGALRM running to support concurrency, interrupted calls are a significant potential problem.
2010-02-23-00.23.14: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/xcore.api: For clarity, renamed Authentication,AUTHENTICATION -> Xauthentication,XAUTHENTICATION, similar renamings elsewhere.
2010-02-22-23.36.17: src/lib/x-kit/: draw/get-display(api,pkg) had nothing to do with drawing and no real distinction from xclient/xauthentication(api,pkg) functionality, so merged former into latter to reduce clutter and rationalize. For clarity, renamed fn parse_display -> parse_xdisplay_string, fn get_display -> get_xdisplay_string_and_xauthentication.
2010-02-22-23.02.55: src/lib/x-kit/: X authentication has nothing to do with X drawing, so moved x11-authentication.(api,pkg) from draw/ -> xclient/, renaming to xauthentication.(api,pkg) for stylistic consistency with the other files there.
2010-02-22-22.44.25: src/lib/x-kit/draw/x11-authentication.api: For clarity, renamed auth_file_name -> get_xauthority_filename, get_auth_by_addr -> get_xauthority_file_entry_by_address, get_best_auth_by_addr -> get_best_xauthority_file_entry_by_address, read_authentication_file -> get_selected_xauthority_file_entries, auth_names -> acceptable_authentication_methods.
2010-02-22-22.03.28: src/lib/x-kit/draw/: For clarity renamed xauth.api,xauth.pkg -> x11-authentication.api,x11-authentication.pkg.
2010-02-22-02.39.44: src/runtime/c-libs/lib7-socket/: sendbuf.c, recv.c: More tracelog print_if stuff.
2010-02-22-00.20.26: src/runtime/c-libs/lib7-socket/socket.c: Added much tracelog support. src/lib/std/src/socket/socket-guts.pkg: ctl_rcvbuf was bound to ctlSNDBUF instead of ctlRCVBUF. (Should maybe fix this in SML/NJ.) src/runtime/c-libs/lib7-socket/*.c: Commenting.
2010-02-21-11.46.34: src/runtime/c-libs/lib7-time/timeofday.c: Make return (sec,usec) value available at C (as well as Mythryl) level.  src/runtime/c-libs/lib7-socket/print-if.c: Use preceding to timestamp tracelog messages in format matching print_if from src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/lib/tracing.pkg. Also, support printf-style formatting via vsnprintf.
2010-02-21-03.50.40: src/runtime/c-libs/lib7-socket/: Rename settracefn.c -> setprintiffn.c, add print-if.c to do actual trace logging from C code.
2010-02-21-01.53.21: src/runtime/c-libs/lib7-socket/: Create settracefn.c to support C-level tracing coordinated with tracing.pkg.  src/lib/std/src/socket/internet-socket.pkg: Add set_trace_fd call providing access to preceding.
2010-02-21-01.10.34: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/lib/tracing.pkg: Add logic to pry Unix fd out of Output_Stream value.
2010-02-20-23.10.59: src/lib/std/src/io/pure-io.api: Tidying.
2010-02-20-22.53.20: src/lib/std/src/posix/posix-io.pkg: Tidying.
2010-02-20-22.06.00: src/lib/std/src/posix/posix-io.pkg: Tidying, renaming for clarity.
2010-02-20-15.12.56: src/lib/std/src/io/file-g.pkg: Tidying.
2010-02-20-14.12.59: src/lib/std/src/: Renamed Base-imp.make6 -> stdlib-core.make6 for clarity and to reserve <<imp>> for threadservers.
2010-02-20-13.45.53: src/lib/std/src/unsafe/cinterface.pkg and kith: Light commenting and tidying.
2010-02-20-13.05.52: src/runtime/c-libs/unix-raise-syserr.c: Save errno value early to be on the safe side.
2010-02-20-11.31.32: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/xsocket.pkg: Implement and export bytes_to_hex, bytes_to_ascii, string_to_hex, string_to_ascii. (They belong elsewhere.)  src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/display.pkg: More trace print_ifs taking advantage of preceding.
2010-02-20-02.56.46: src/runtime/c-libs/unix-raise-syserr.c and kith:  Commenting.
2010-02-20-02.02.54: src/lib/std/src/socket/socket-guts.pkg: Tidying.
2010-02-19-17.28.39: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/display.pkg: Trace listing of generated socket. src/lib/std/src/socket/internet-socket.pkg: Added to_string() to support previous.
2010-02-19-16.41.34: src/lib/std/src/socket/internet-socket.pkg: Tidying.
2010-02-19-16.14.28: src/runtime/c-libs/lib7-c.h: Report line number as well as filename in RAISE_SYSERR and RAISE_ERROR macros.
2010-02-19-13.54.29: src/lib/std/src/: Renamed string-conversion.api,string-conversion.pkg -> number-string.api,number-string.pkg for brevity and clarity -- they are more about numbers than strings.
2010-02-19-13.08.32: src/lib/std/src/socket/: Renamed unix-generic-socket.pkg -> generic-socket.pkg for clarity and as part of concentrating on being posix-centric rather than cross-platform-centric.
2010-02-19-12.58.16: src/lib/std/src/string-conversion.api: For clarity, renamed Realfmt -> Real_Format and DEC/BIN/OCT -> DECIMAL/BINARY/OCTAL.
2010-02-19-12.04.32: src/lib/std/src/: Removed word.api, which was apparently just an old and unused copy of unt.api.
2010-02-19-11.53.09: src/lib/std/src/: Contents of word.api, unt.api were nearly identical; renamed div,mod -> /,% to make them fully identical.
2010-02-18-22.15.18: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/crack-xserver-address.api: Added to_string.  src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/display.pkg: connect_to_xserver: Addional tracing.
2010-02-18-20.42.49: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/crack-xserver-address.api: Renamed INET_ADDR -> INET_ADDRESS for clarity. src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/display.pkg: connect_to_xserver: Additional tracing printouts.
2010-02-18-20.17.09: src/lib/internet/socket-stuff.pkg: Light cleaning.
2010-02-18-19.46.24: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/display.pkg: say_hello_to_xserver: retry: Log exceptions caught by name instead of silently discarding.
2010-02-18-16.39.35: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/lib/tracing.pkg: Tweak and date generated tracelog header. src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/stuff/xclient-unit-test.pkg: Remove an inappropriate newline.
2010-02-18-16.15.14: src/lib/std/src/time.api: Got tired of the redundancy of time::get_time(), changed it to time::get(). Added some comments.  Makefile: somewhat-clean: Remove all .log files.
2010-02-18-12.06.32: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/display.pkg: Write to tracelog X server connection request reply. Minor cleaning.
2010-02-17-23.18.23: x-kit/xclient/src/stuff/xclient-unit-test.pkg: Fetch value of DISPLAY environment variable.
2010-02-17-22.51.09: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/stuff/xclient-unit-test.pkg: Start up and shut down thread scheduler.
2010-02-17-22.35.03: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/stuff/xclient-unit-test.pkg: Set up to log trace messages to xclient-unit-test-trace.log.
2010-02-17-21.20.32: src/lib/core/internal/make7.api: Added mkdir, rename, rmdir, symlink, unlink -- all basic scripting functions posix folk expect to find readily available.
2010-02-17-20.00.36: src/lib/std/src/io/: For simplicity and consistency renamed threadkit-text-io-g.pkg, thread_text_io_g -> threadkit-file-g.pkg, threadkit_file_g.
2010-02-17-19.46.12: src/lib/std/src/io/: For simplicity and consistency renamed threadkit-text-io.api, Threadkit_Text_Io -> threadkit-file.api, Threadkit_File.
2010-02-17-19.29.43: src/lib/std/src/io/: For simplicity and consistency renamed text-io-g.pkg,text_io_g -> file-g.pkg,file_g.
2010-02-17-19.04.06: src/lib/std/src/io/: Renamed text-io.api -> file.api (and Text_Io -> File) for simplicity and consistency.
2010-02-17-18.30.46: src/lib/std/src/unix/: Renamed posix-file.pkg -> file.pkg because the package it contains is named file, to avoid confusion with src/lib/std/src/posix/posix-file.pkg, and because I want to make Mythryl posix-centric rather than primarily cross-platform.
2010-02-17-14.31.33: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/stuff/xclient-unit-test.pkg: (Re-)Established this unit test: Now is is run by src/lib/test/all-unit-tests.pkg (like all unit tests) but compiled by src/lib/x-kit/xclient/xclient-internals.make6 so as to have access to internal xclient packages for testing. This is probably a better pattern for large libraries than having all unit tests compiled by src/lib/test/unit-tests.make6, my previous approach.
2010-02-16-02.13.58: src/app/make7/main/make7-g.pkg: Bugfix for parsing -Cfoo=bar commandline switches, contributed by Jeffrey Lau (thanks!)
2010-02-15-20.43.43: Test...

2010-01-31-15.40.05: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/protocol/: Renamed wire-to-xreplies.pkg -> wire-to-value.pkg (more accurate -- it handles X replies, but also X events and X errors).

2010-01-30-14.49.12: src/lib/x-kit/: For clarity, renamed lib/ -> xclient/, since in fact it implements network-level X client functionality.

2010-01-30-14.13.21: src/lib/x-kit/lib/client-interface/: Renamed iccc.pkg -> xselection.pkg for clarity and coherency.

2010-01-29-23.35.28: src/lib/x-kit/lib/client-interface/: I like a simple one-package-per-file approach, so I broke build.pkg up into drawing.pkg, font.pkg, geometry-2d.pkg, iccc.pkg, standard-xcursors.pkg, xcore.pkg, xinput.pkg, xkit-window.pkg.

2010-01-28-21.10.53: src/lib/x-kit/widget/fancy/2d-graphics/: Renamed Makefile.make6 -> xkit-widget-fancy-graphics2d.make6. Trivial, since the code in this directory is not currently compiled -- or compilable.

2010-01-28-13.04.23: src/lib/x-kit/lib/user: Renamed x-kit.pkg -> xkit.pkg
2010-01-28-12.38.45: src/lib/x-kit/lib/: Renamed util/ -> hash/ because it contains hashing code; Renamed misc/ -> stuff/ because 'stuff' is at least an English word.

2010-01-23-13.57.24: src/lib/x-kit/widget/: Created node/ because I want to distinguish between child-owning widgets which do/not do nontrivial layout.  Moved background.pkg, border.pkg and shape-constraint.pkg into it.
2010-01-23-13.40.59: src/lib/x-kit/widget/layout/border.api: Renamed make_border { ... widget ... } -> child because that is what it is -- why be coy\?
2010-01-23-13.12.29: src/lib/x-kit/widget/layout/: Renamed frame.pkg -> border.pkg because all the docs and comments describe it as drawing a border -- why not call a spade a spade\?
2010-01-23-12.49.25: src/lib/x-kit/widget/layout/: Renamed lay-out-boxes.pkg -> lay-out-linearly.pkg to reflect change in name of line-of-widgets.pkg.
2010-01-23-12.11.11: src/lib/x-kit/widget/layout/line-of-widgets.api: Renamed map,unmap -> show,hide for better length symmetry, for compatibility with similar renamings done in other packages, and because that is what they do, dammit! :-)
2010-01-23-11.52.59: src/lib/x-kit/widget/layout/line-of-widgets.api: Added many comments swiped from the Gansner+Reppy 1993 eXene widget manual.
2010-01-22-23.05.02: src/lib/x-kit/widget/layout/line-of-widgets.api: Renamed WBOX to WIDGET because that is what it bloody well is -- why be coy?
2010-01-22-22.41.59: src/lib/x-kit/widget/layout/: Renamed linear-layout.pkg -> line-of-widgets.pkg, for clarity and for consistency with pile-of-widgets.pkg nomenclature. Various related renaming such as GLUE -> SPACER.
2010-01-22-21.39.29: src/lib/x-kit/widget/layout/scrollbar-layout.api: Remove spuriously exported w (widget) package. That sort of empty generalization reduces readability pointlessly.
2010-01-22-20.18.19: src/lib/x-kit/widget/: Renamed compound/ -> layout/ for brevity, clarity, and because the main business of and distinctions between them are their window layout algorithms.
2010-01-22-19.59.19: src/lib/x-kit/widget/basic/topwindow.pkg: Renamed Hints -> Hints, set_wmhints -> set_window_manager_hints, for clarity.
2010-01-22-19.45.12: src/lib/x-kit/widget/basic/topwindow.pkg: Renamed wm_hints field -> nonsize_hints for better parallelism with size_hints.
2010-01-16-22.19.13: src/lib/x-kit/widget/basic/: widget.api, topwindow.api: Various commenting and cleaning. Dropped pretense that Wm_Args is abstract and renamed it to Window_And_Icon_Names, since that is what it in fact is.
2010-01-16-22.19.13: src/lib/x-kit/widget/basic/: Renamed root.pkg -> root-window.pkg.
2010-01-16-18.15.24: src/lib/x-kit/widget/compound/: Renamed pile.pkg -> pile-of-widgets.pkg for clarity. (Also split off pile-of-widgets.api as a separate file, as usual.)
2010-01-16-17.52.38: src/lib/x-kit/widget/basic/widget.api: Renamed size_constraint_fn -> size_constraint_thunk_of. (Continued cleanup from last major code transform.)
2010-01-16-17.29.15: src/lib/x-kit/widget/basic/widget.api: Renamed size_constraint_thunk_of -> size_constraint_of. (Correcting overshoot in previous code transform.)
2010-01-16-15.12.26: src/lib/x-kit/widget/basic/widget-base.api: More bound -> contraint renaming.
2010-01-16-14.57.46: src/lib/x-kit/widget/basic/widget-base.api: Renamed min_dim,nat_dim,max_dim -> minimum_length,preferred_length,maximum_length.
2010-01-16-14.13.08: src/lib/x-kit/widget/basic/widget-base.api: Renamed fix_dim,flex_dim -> tight_cosntraint,loose_constraint to include 'contraint' tie-noun an improve length symmetry, and because 'flex' suggests bending rather than stretching.
2010-01-15-22.08.45: src/lib/x-kit/widget/basic/widget-base.api: Renamed INT_CONSTRAINT fields base,step,min,nat,max -> start_at,step_by,min_steps,preferred_steps,max_steps, for clarity.
2010-01-15-21.12.20: src/lib/x-kit/widget/basic/widget-base.api: Renamed Dim,DIM -> Int_Constraint,INT_CONSTRAINT because that is what they bloody well are. :-)
2010-01-15-20.20.06: src/lib/x-kit/widget/basic/widget-base.api: Rename Bounds -> Widget_Shape_Constraints.
2010-01-15-19.07.48: src/lib/x-kit/graphlib/cartouche.api:  Replaced c_wid,c_ht cryptonym parameters with single corner_radius parameter for clarity, brevity and convenience.
2010-01-15-17.02.51: src/lib/x-kit/lib/iccc/xatom.pkg,atom-imp.pkg: Renamed intern_atom -> make_atom because 'intern' is not a word; renamed lookup_atom -> find_atom because 'lookup' is a noun, not a verb; renamed name_of_atom -> atom_to_string because that is more precise.
2010-01-15-04.32.09: src/lib/x-kit/lib/user/drawing.api: For clarity renamed feedback() -> make_unbuffered_drawable() and create_overlay() -> make_locked_window(). (The latter appears unused and perhaps not fully implemented.)
2010-01-15-03.52.43: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/: Rename keysym-trans.pkg -> keysym-to-ascii.pkg, inside it rename lookup() -> map_keysym_to_ascii() etc.
2010-01-14-22.29.43: src/lib/x-kit/lib/user/interact.api: Renaming and commenting for clarity.
2010-01-14-21.00.42: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/widget-cable.pkg:  More commenting, and renaming for clarity.
2010-01-14-20.50.26: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/widget-cable.pkg:  Commenting, and renaming for clarity.
2010-01-14-20.29.16: src/lib/x-kit/lib/user/interact.api: Additional commenting.
2010-01-14-20.07.18: src/lib/x-kit/lib/user/interact.api: Additional commenting.
2010-01-14-20.07.18: src/lib/x-kit/lib/user/interact.api: More commenting and renaming for clarity.
2010-01-14-19.36.56: src/lib/x-kit/lib/protocol/keys-and-buttons.pkg: Commenting, and renaming for clarity.
2010-01-14-18.31.58: src/lib/x-kit/lib/user/drawing.api: Renamed clear_area -> clear_box, image_string -> draw_opaque_string, draw_string -> draw_transparent_string, draw_text -> draw_transparent_text.
2010-01-13-22.32.25: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/pen.pkg: Minor misc cleanup.
2010-01-13-21.47.13: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/pen-guts.pkg: Random cleanup.
2010-01-13-21.20.08: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/pen.pkg: More cleanup.
2010-01-13-20.06.33: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/pen.pkg: Renamed new_pen() -> make_pen() because 'new' is not a verb, dammit. Also update_pen() -> clone_pen() because it is shorter and clearer.
2010-01-13-19.50.23: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/pen.pkg: Random cleanup.
2010-01-13-18.22.14: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/: Renamed pen-rep.pkg -> pen-guts.pkg because 'guts' is an honest, pungent Anglo-Saxon word while 'rep' is just the gray shade of a word wanna-be.
2010-01-13-16.14.45: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/window.pkg: Renamed map_window,unmap_window -> show_window,hide_window, because 'map' is a terrible word anyhow, plus it has strong unrelated associations in Mythryl.
2010-01-13-15.16.51: src/lib/x-kit/lib/iccc/iccc-property.pkg: Rename Size_Hints -> Window_Manager_Size_Hint, Window_Manager_Hints -> Window_Manager_Hint.
2010-01-13-14.24.22: src/lib/x-kit/lib/iccc/: Renamed xprops.pkg -> iccc-property.pkg.

2010-01-13-13.58.32: Finish previous transform. (Oops!)
2010-01-13-13.31.58: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/xcursor.pkg: Rename Cursor,CURSOR -> Xcursor,XCURSOR.
2010-01-13-13.14.54: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/xcursor.pkg: Renamed std_cursor() -> get_standard_xcursor().
2010-01-12-23.33.06: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/: Renamed cursor.pkg -> xcursor.pkg; within renamed Std_Cursor -> Standard_Xcursor etc.
2010-01-12-22.48.46: src/lib/x-kit/: Random low-level cleanup and commenting, mostly in *window.pkg + cursor.pkg.
2010-01-12-16.21.14: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/draw-types.pkg: Renamed Drawable -> Drawable_Window for clarity.
2010-01-12-16.00.25: src/lib/x-kit/: Globally renamed geometry_of_ -> shape_of_ because 'geometry' is way too long relative to frequency of use. (Zipf lives!)
2010-01-12-15.48.29: src/lib/x-kit/widget/compound/: Renamed shape.pkg -> shape-constraint.pkg.
2010-01-12-15.33.24: src/lib/x-kit/widget/lib/readonly-window-cache.pkg: Additional cleanup.
2010-01-12-14.48.27: src/lib/x-kit/widget/lib/: Renamed tile-imp.pkg -> readonly-window-cache.pkg.
2010-01-12-14.28.54: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/: Renamed image.pkg -> clientside-window.pkg to work in 'window' tie noun, because 'image' is over-used and vague, and because that is what they in fact are.
2010-01-12-13.32.01: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/: Renamed tile.pkg -> readonly-window.pkg -- because that is what they in fact are.
2010-01-12-12.44.42: src/lib/x-kit/lib/: Changed mind, 'window' is a better tie-noun than 'pixmap' here. Renamed pixmap/ back to window/.  Renamed window/offscreen-pixmap.pkg -> window/offscreen-window.pkg.
2010-01-12-12.08.47: src/lib/x-kit/lib/: Renamed window/ -> pixmap/.
2010-01-12-11.26.58: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/: Renamed rw-pixmap.pkg to offscreen-pixmap.pkg. (Decided to use 'pixmap' as the tie noun for drawables.)
2010-01-12-03.53.04: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/: Renamed pixmap.pkg -> rw-pixmap.pkg.
2010-01-11-23.16.58: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/draw-types.pkg: Renamed WSRC,PMSRC,TSRC -> FROM_WINDOW,FROM_PIXMAP,FROM_TILE for clarity.
2010-01-11-23.03.52: src/lib/x-kit/lib/user/geometry-2d.api:  WINDOW_GEOMETRY: Renamed 'border' -> 'border_width' for clarity.
2010-01-11-22.45.59: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/xsession.pkg: Commenting and cleaning.
2010-01-11-20.56.02: src/lib/x-kit/lib/user/geometry-2d.api: Renamed bound_box -> bounding_box.  In WINDOW_GEOMETRY renamed pos -> upperleft.
2010-01-11-15.47.02: src/lib/x-kit/lib/user/geometry-2d.api: Renamed origin_of_box,corner_of_box -> upperleft_of_box,lowerright_of_box because there are no points for obscurity in open source.
2010-01-11-15.09.42: src/lib/x-kit/: Renamed graph-util/ -> graphlib/.
2010-01-11-14.45.16: src/lib/x-kit/widget/: Renamed util/ to the more traditional lib/.
2010-01-11-14.27.44: src/lib/x-kit/widget/: Renamed composite/ -> compound/.  Saves a syllable!
2010-01-11-14.13.27: src/lib/x-kit/widget/: Renamed basics/ -> basic/.
2010-01-11-13.55.38: src/lib/x-kit/widget/basics/topwindow.pkg: Rename init() -> start(), because that is what it does, and because 'start' at least is an actual word! :-)
2010-01-11-13.42.22: src/lib/x-kit/widget/basics/: Renamed shell.pkg -> topwindow.pkg, because it has nothing to do with bash or tcsh and everything to do with toplevel application windows.
2010-01-11-12.53.52: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/: Renamed xtopwwindow-xevent-router-imp.pkg -> xbuf-to-widgettree-xevent-router.pkg. Renamed top-level-window.pkg -> widgettree-root-xevent-router.pkg.
2010-01-11-04.03.45: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/: Renamed window-lock-imp.pkg -> topwindows-xevent-router-imp.pkg. (Locking turns out to be only a secondary function of this imp.)
2010-01-11-03.06.58: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/: Renamed keymap.pkg -> keymap-imp.pkg, since it in fact implements an imp.
2010-01-11-02.21.07: src/lib/x-kit/lib/iccc/: Renamed xatoms.pkg -> xatom.pkg. (I reserve plural names for packages implementing collections.)
2010-01-11-01.55.16: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/xsession.pkg: Strip dippy dpy_ prefixes from request* and flush function names.
2010-01-11-01.37.09: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/xsession.pkg: Random cleanup.
2010-01-11-01.01.25: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/: Renamed display.pkg -> xsession.pkg because the display/xdisplay distinction was confusing, and because it in fact manages the X session.
2010-01-10-23.24.58: src/lib/x-kit/lib/protocol/: Renamed xclient-socket.pkg -> xsocket.pkg etc.
2010-01-10-22.23.32: src/lib/x-kit/example/: Renamed widgets/ -> widget/. src/lib/x-kit/style/: Renamed styles-g.pkg -> style-g.pkg.

2010-01-10-21.36.04: src/lib/x-kit/: Renamed widgets/ -> widget/ because plural directory names are just wasted bandwidth.
2010-01-10-21.09.50: src/lib/x-kit/widgets: Renamed simple/ -> leaf/ for brevity -- and because widget-hierarchy leaf widgets are often far from simple!
2010-01-10-15.48.47: src/lib/x-kit/lib/protocol/: Renamed xcvtfns.pkg -> xprotocol-wire-encoding.pkg -- because that is what the package does! :-)
2010-01-10-13.25.16: src/lib/x-kit/lib/protocol/: Renamed xio.pkg -> xsocket-client.pkg, because what it actually does is manage X client socket I/O.
2010-01-10-03.23.24: src/lib/x-kit/: Even more request -> plea renaming.
2010-01-10-01.38.48: src/lib/x-kit/: Yup, still more request -> plea renaming.
2010-01-09-22.46.38: src/lib/x-kit/: Still more request -> plea renaming.
2010-01-09-22.10.24: src/lib/x-kit/widgets/simple/: Renamed label-bttn-view.pkg -> labelled-button-view.pkg, similarly the pkg.
2010-01-09-20.37.42: src/lib/x-kit/: More request -> plea renaming.
2010-01-09-20.02.29: src/lib/x-kit/: Much renaming of req and request -> plea, for brevity and clarity.
2010-01-09-18.48.25: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/: Renamed draw-master.pkg -> draw-imp.pkg and pkg draw_master -> draw_imp.
2010-01-09-15.00.44: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/: Renamed window-registry.pkg -> window-lock-imp.pkg, etc.
2010-01-09-02.01.31: src/lib/x-kit/lib/protocol/: Renamed xreply.pkg -> wire-to-xreplies.pkg; Renamed pkg xreply -> wire_to_xreplies.
2010-01-08-21.46.19: src/lib/x-kit/lib/protocol/: Renamed xrequest.pkg -> xrequest-to-wire.pkg; Renamed pkg xrequest -> xrequest_to_wire.
2010-01-08-20.07.48: src/lib/x-kit/lib/protocol/: Rename xprottypes.pkg -> xprotocol-types.pkg.
2010-01-08-17.34.19: src/lib/x-kit/lib/protocol/: Renamed xevttypes.pkg -> xevent-types.pkg, cleanup in xio.pkg, split off xio.api from xio.pkg.

2010-01-05-18.27.39: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/lib/tracing.pkg: Generate explanatory headers for tracelog files. No, that is not unixy. But I like non-mysterious.
2010-01-05-18.06.19: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/lib/tracing.pkg: Increase print_if timestamp resolution from milliseconds to microseconds. Change ancestors() to return a list of names rather than nodes. (More useful.)
2010-01-05-17.46.04: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/lib/tracing.pkg: Tweak print_if to log name of controlling tracetree node.
2010-01-05-17.19.50: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/lib/tracing.pkg:  Tweaked make_trace_tree_leaf to raise an exception for duplicate node name, instead of returning pre-existing node. Replaced module_of by node_by_name which searches by name rather than full_name (i.e., by local notname instead of by a /path/name).
2010-01-05-16.32.25: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/lib/tracing.pkg: Replaced TRACE_TREE_NODE.full_name field with TRACE_TREE_NODE.parent field, killed module_of(), added exported parent() and ancestors() functions.
2010-01-05-15.50.57: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/lib/tracing.pkg: Adopt the convention that TRACE_TREE_NODE.label (renamed TRACE_TREE_NODE.name) is foo::tracing or such -- commandline expression for controlling node.
2010-01-05-15.26.15: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/lib/tracing.pkg: Adopt the convention that TRACE_TREE_NODE.label (renamed TRACE_TREE_NODE.name) is foo::tracing or such -- commandline expression for controlling node.
2010-01-05-14.48.42: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/lib/tracing.pkg: Added timestamping to print_if(); Moved newline generation responsibility from print_if() callers to print_if() itself.
2010-01-05-12.35.00: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/lib/tracing.api: Added a long top-of-file OVERVIEW comment section.
2010-01-05-12.35.00: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/lib/tracing.pkg: Renaming for clarity: status -> subtree_nods_and_tracing_flags, set_trace_file (TRACE_TO_FILE foo.log) -> log_trace_messages (TO_FILE foo.log).

2010-01-03-15.25.36: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/core-thread-kit/thread.pkg: Added name: String field to THREAD_ID record and name arg to make_thread. (Kids these days! When will they learn? :-)

2010-01-03-03.18.02: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/lib/: Renamed thread-spy.pkg -> tracing.pkg (etc), since the remaining code now has a clear focus.
2010-01-03-02.59.28: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/lib/: Split off part of thread-spy.pkg to create threadkit-uncaught-exception-reporting.pkg -- that code is unrelated to rest of package and did not belong in there.
2010-01-03-02.34.09: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/lib/: Split off part of thread-spy.pkg to create thread-deathwatch.pkg -- that code is unrelated to rest of package and did not belong in there.
2010-01-03-02.01.30: src/lib/x-kit/lib/misc/xdebug.pkg: Renamed sel_tm -> selection_tracing etc, for clarity.
2010-01-03-01.26.45: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/lib/thread-spy.api: Renamed trace -> print_if etc.

2010-01-01-19.57.53: src/lib/x-kit:  Rename winreg.pkg -> window-registry.pkg, screen_pt -> screen_point, but -> button ... 
2010-01-01-13.04.53: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/widget-cable.pkg: Rename Trans -> Transition, because the latter is an actual word.
2009-12-31-20.01.06: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/: Renamed window-dictionary.pkg -> widget-cable.pkg, In_Env -> Kidplug, Out_Env -> Momplug etc.
2009-12-31-17.32.24: Pervasively renamed src,dst -> from,to -- because the Queen's English is not just for the Queen any more! :-)
2009-12-31-16.05.22: src/lib/x-kit/: Pervasively renamed rect to box because box is a vibrant, living word but rect is just the mutilated corpse of a pedanticism.
2009-12-31-05.05.10: src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/graph-view/geometry-2d-float.pkg: Rename RPT -> POINT for clarity, etc.

2009-12-30-20.54.44: More mk_* -> make_* renaming. Remember, every time you abbreviate, God kills a kitten.

2009-12-30-19.56.22: Rename mk_ to make_ various places.
2009-12-30-15.20.24: Did global rename of *_rect to *_rectangle. (What is it with these creepy word mutilation cults? :-)
2009-12-30-04.03.31: src/lib/x-kit/lib/protocol/: Renamed keybut.pkg to keys-and-buttons.pkg.

2009-12-29-21.08.02: Renamed src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/graph-view/geometry-float.pkg -> src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/graph-view/geometry-2d-float.pkg.
2009-12-29-20.57.56: Renamed src/lib/x-kit/graph-util/rounded-rect.pkg -> src/lib/x-kit/graph-util/cartouche.pkg because that is the correct term.
2009-12-29-20.43.58: Removed src/lib/x-kit/lib/graph-util/* -- these files were all unused, redundant copies of files in src/lib/x-kit/graph-util/.
2009-12-29-20.30.18: Renamed src/lib/x-kit/lib/basics/geometry.pkg -> src/lib/x-kit/lib/user/geometry-2d.pkg.

2009-12-28-23.30.35: src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer: Now compiling and exercised by 'make rest' to keep it that way: main/main.pkg, graph-view/graph-view.pkg. (Basically all the examples/ml-viewer/ code is now compiling.)
2009-12-28-21.44.56: src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/text-view: Renamed viewer.pkg -> ml-source-code-viewer.pkg.
2009-12-28-18.35.29: src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer: Now compiling and exercised by 'make rest' to keep it that way: in util/: get-mouse-selection.pkg; in text-view/: text-display.pkg, approximate-ml.lex, scroll-viewer.pkg, viewer.pkg, text-canvas.pkg, view-buffer.pkg, load-file-g.pkg, ml-viewer.pkg; in graph-view/: graph-viewer.pkg. (That was a thrash!)
2009-12-24-19.31.02: src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/graph-view: view-font.pkg and dotgraph-to-planargraph.pkg now compiling and exercised by 'make rest' to keep it that way.
2009-12-24-14.30.57: src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/graph-view/planar-subgraph-tree.pkg: Now compiling and exercised by 'make rest' to keep it that way.
2009-12-24-11.54.33: src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/graph: dot-graph.grammar, dot-graph.lex and dot-subgraph-tree.pkg now compile, and 'make rest' exercises them. (That was a thrash!)
2009-12-19-20.59.26: src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/graph/dot-graph-io-g.pkg now compiles, and 'make rest' exercises it to make sure it stays compiling.
2009-12-19-20.15.40: src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/graph/dot-graph.grammar now compiles, and 'make rest' exercises it to make sure it stays compiling.
2009-12-19-19.47.05: Renamed float::trunc to float::truncate, although there is a certain perverse irony in truncating the world truncate itself...
2009-12-19-19.32.33: src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/graph-view/geometry-float.pkg now compiles, and 'make rest'' exercises it to make sure it stays compiling.
2009-12-19-19.02.30: src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/graph/dot-subgraph-tree-attributes.pkg now compiles, and 'make rest' exercises it to make sure it stays compiling.
2009-12-19-18.50.30: src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/graph/attributed-subgraph-tree-g.pkg now compiles, and 'make rest' exercises it to make sure it stays compiling.
2009-12-17-13.23.28: Got src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/graph/subgraph-tree-g.pkg to compile, partly by dint of rewriting it to use red-black trees instead of splaytrees. To keep it compiling, created a build-ml-viewer script and added it to 'make rest'. This means the complete ml-viewer example/app is maybe 5-10% of the way to compiling.
2009-12-15-10.18.35: Deleted src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/graph-view/save/ and also all *.sav files under ml-viewer/.
2009-12-15-09.55.44: Deleted src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/util/mlyacc-base.pkg -- how many copies of this do we need?
2009-12-14-18.37.06: src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/graph/: Renamed attribute_graph* -> attributed_graph* per comments found in src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/GRAPHS.OVERVIEW.  Low-level cleanup on both .api and -g.pkg files.
2009-12-13-21.24.37: Low-level code cleanup throughout src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/graph/.
2009-12-13-18.44.47: Deleted src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/graph/mlyacc-base.pkg -- another ml-yacc implementation file just floating around. Random cleanup in src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/graph/.
2009-12-13-13.47.45: Deleted entire src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/data/src/ directory, which appeared to contain primarily (only?) a redundant, unmaintained copy of ml-yacc.
2009-12-13-12.28.25: Deleted src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/library/lib-base.pkg:  It was just an ancestral version of src/lib/src/lib-base.pkg.
2009-12-12-21.30.26: src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/library/: Deleted static-array.api + lib-sg.pkg, both uninteresting scraps of dead code.
2009-12-12-21.20.09: Deleted src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/library/string-covnersion.pkg:  Ancient implementations of atoi &tc -- stuff much better done these days using scanf or whatever.
2009-12-12-21.08.25: Deleted src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/library/time-limit.pkg:  A 20-line package nowhere used whose functionality is subsumed by the threadkit timeout_in mailop and such.
2009-12-12-20.56.47: src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/library/: Deleted unix-path.pkg + pathnamee.pkg: stdlib already has quite enough of this kind of functionality.
2009-12-12-20.46.02: Deleted src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/library/makestring.pkg:  It provided simple formatting of ints and floats as strings, but newer packages like sfprintf do the same thing much better.
2009-12-12-20.33.33: Deleted src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/library/hash-string.pkg:  A later version of the same code is available from src/lib/x-kit/lib/util/hash-util.pkg and the same functionality is available from src/lib/src/hash-string.pkg.
2009-12-12-20.20.23: src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/library/: Deleted binary-dict.pkg + binary-set.pkg -- the same Stephen Adams binary tree code that stdlib already has in src/lib/src/binary-map-g.pkg, src/lib/src/binary-set-g.pkg &tc &tc.
2009-12-12-20.01.20: Deleted src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/library/hash-table.pkg:  It was just an earlier version of src/lib/src/monomorphic-hash-table-g.pkg.

2009-12-12-18.52.13: src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/library/: Deleted intset.pkg + intmap.pkg -- they were just ancestral versions of src/lib/src/int-binary-set.pkg + src/lib/src/int-binary-map.pkg.
2009-12-12-18.42.23: Deleted src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/library/key-set.api:  It appeared nearly identical to src/lib/src/set.api.
2009-12-12-18.32.43: Deleted src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/library/random.pkg:  It appeared to be an ancestral version of src/lib/src/rand.pkg.
2009-12-12-18.14.40: Deleted src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/library/queue.pkg:  It was a straight clone of src/lib/src/queue.pkg.
2009-12-12-17.59.02: Installed src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/library/list-util.pkg as src/lib/src/list-fns.pkg because it appears to be useful functionality not already present in stdlib.
2009-12-12-17.16.48: Deleted src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/library/list-to-string.pkg:  It was just the ancestral version of src/lib/src/list-to-string.pkg + src/lib/src/string-to-list.pkg.
2009-12-12-17.06.36: Deleted src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/library/list-mergesort.pkg:  It was nearly identical to src/lib/src/list-mergesort.pkg.
2009-12-12-16.55.40: Deleted src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/library/list-sort.api:  It was a straight clone of src/lib/src/list-sort.api.
2009-12-12-16.45.30: Deleted src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/library/fifo.pkg:  It was nearly identical to src/lib/src/fifo.pkg.
2009-12-12-16.24.06: Deleted src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/library/hash-key.api:  It was a straight clone of src/lib/src/hash-key.api.
2009-12-12-16.11.42: Deleted src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/library/name.pkg:  Did not do anything not already done by src/lib/src/quickstring*pkg.
2009-12-12-12.53.28: Deleted src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/library/iterate.pkg:  It was identical to src/lib/src/iterate.pkg. The latter was not being compiled into stdlib, so fixed that too.
2009-12-12-12.00.22: Deleted src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/library/matrix.pkg:  It was identical to src/lib/src/matrix.pkg.
2009-12-11-14.56.50: src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/library/key.api:  It was just an early version of src/lib/src/key.api.
2009-12-11-14.41.56: Deleted src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/library/format.pkg: Looked like a very early version of the code in src/lib/src/sfprintf.pkg + src/lib/src/scanf.pkg (and thence sprintf() &tc).
2009-12-11-14.31.58: Deleted src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/library/dynamic-array.pkg: It was essentially identical to src/lib/src/expanding-rw-vector.pkg in stdlib.
2009-12-11-14.20.28: Deleted src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/library/rw-vector-quicksort.pkg: It was essentially identical to src/lib/src/rw-vector-quicksort-g.pkg in stdlib.
2009-12-11-02.39.58: src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/library/charset.pkg: This contained functionality not in stdlib: Cleaned it up and moved to stdlib.
2009-12-11-01.46.46: src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/library/ctype.pkg: This contained functionality not in stdlib: Split into int-ctype.pkg + string-ctype.pkg and moved to stdlib.
2009-12-10-05.51.48: src/lib/x-kit/examples/widgets/widgets.make6 now compiles, added it to 'make rest' to keep it doing so.

2009-12-09-03.07.25: src/lib/x-kit/examples/bitmap-editor/bitmap-editor.make6 now compiles, added it to 'make rest' to keep it doing so.
